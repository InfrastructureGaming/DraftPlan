# MASTER TO-DO LIST

This is a comprehensive to-do list encompassing this entire project. It is designed to be a living document, acting as a kind of "scratch pad" for us to track tasks during working sessions.

This document should be kept updated during programming sessions, and referenced regularly throughout development.

## Current Sprint - In Progress

### 1. 3D Transformation Gizmo Widget
**Goal:** Add visual axis handles for intuitive object manipulation in 3D space

**Status:** ✅ Complete (Phase 1)
**Priority:** High (Critical UX improvement for 3D manipulation)

**Phase 1 - Move Mode:**
- [x] Create TransformGizmo component with SVG rendering
- [x] Position gizmo at selected object's world position
- [x] Draw three axis arrows (X=Red, Y=Green, Z=Blue)
- [x] Implement click detection for each axis
- [x] Handle drag along constrained axis (single axis movement)
- [x] Add real-time numerical feedback during drag (+X.XX")
- [x] Scale gizmo with zoom for consistent visibility
- [x] Add gizmo visibility toggle to View menu
- [x] Fix coordinate transformation for smooth, flicker-free dragging
- [x] Test in all views (orthographic + isometric)
- [ ] Add planar movement squares (XY, XZ, YZ planes) - Future enhancement

**Phase 2 - Settings (Optional enhancement):**
- [ ] Add "Gizmo Scale" slider in Settings panel

**Phase 3 - Rotate Mode (Future):**
- [ ] Add rotation rings for each axis
- [ ] Implement rotation angle calculation
- [ ] Add visual feedback during rotation

**Phase 4 - Scale Mode (Future):**
- [ ] Add scale handles at axis endpoints
- [ ] Implement uniform vs non-uniform scaling
- [ ] Add visual feedback during scaling

**Design Decisions:**
- Gizmo appears automatically when object is selected ✅
- Real-time numerical feedback during drag (+/-X.XX") ✅
- Standard industry colors (X=Red, Y=Green, Z=Blue) ✅
- Gizmo scale TBD, will add settings slider if needed ✅
- SVG-based rendering for consistency with existing architecture

**Notes:**
- Start with Move mode only - Rotate and Scale are future enhancements
- Address current issue: 2D mouse movement → 3D transformation is unintuitive
- Will likely hit auto-compact during implementation (todo_master.md survives!)

## Backlog - Future Features

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut reference dialog (Help menu)
- [ ] Annotation tools (text labels, arrows, dimension lines)
- [ ] Manual dimension lines with arrows
- [ ] Improve touch/trackpad gesture support

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Joinery indicators (visual markers for joints)
- [ ] Metric unit support
- [ ] Template library (common projects)
- [ ] Hardware library (screws, hinges, brackets)

### Performance & Polish
- [ ] Object culling for large projects (>500 objects)
- [ ] Implement proper polygon clipping for rotated objects
- [ ] Add loading states for heavy operations
- [ ] Optimize render performance

## Recently Completed ✅

### Session: 2024-12-30
- ✅ **Custom Lumber Library** - Add, edit, and manage custom lumber items
  - "+ Custom" button in Library panel for adding custom items
  - AddCustomLumberModal with form fields for Name, Dimensions, Material, Category
  - customLumberStore for localStorage persistence (survives app restart)
  - Edit/delete buttons appear on hover for custom items
  - Custom items display "Custom" badge for easy identification
  - Custom items fully integrated with drag & drop and all existing features
  - Items grouped by category alongside standard library items
- ✅ **3D Transformation Gizmo** - Visual axis handles for precise object manipulation
  - Industry-standard color coding (X=Red, Y=Green, Z=Blue)
  - Constrained single-axis dragging with real-time numerical feedback
  - Smooth, flicker-free performance using local position deltas
  - Gizmo stays locked to object during pan/zoom operations
  - View-aware axis visibility (only shows relevant axes)
  - Visibility toggle in View menu
- ✅ **Panel Stacking System** - Intelligent panel collapse with space reallocation
  - All three panels (Project Details, Properties, Assemblies) collapsible
  - Collapsed panels take minimal space, expanded panels grow to fill available
  - Centralized collapse state in UIStore for consistency
- ✅ Array Tool implementation (parametric duplication with spacing)
- ✅ Fixed position input bugs in Properties Panel (X/Y/Z editing)
- ✅ View Cube improvements (4 isometric corners, visibility toggle)
- ✅ Made Project Details and Properties panels collapsible
- ✅ Fixed UI spacing issues (no overlapping panels)

### Previous Sessions
- ✅ Multi-project tabs with automatic management
- ✅ Mouse wheel zoom with cursor-centered zooming
- ✅ Recent Projects list in File menu
- ✅ Settings panel with auto-save functionality
- ✅ View Cube with isometric views
- ✅ Rulers with zoom-adaptive grid
- ✅ Alignment tools (align, distribute)
- ✅ Assembly grouping with hierarchical organization
- ✅ Cut list / materials breakdown
- ✅ PDF and PNG export

## Known Issues / Bugs

*No critical bugs currently tracked*

---

## Notes & Decisions

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Using Zustand for state management with selector pattern for reactivity
- Electron for cross-platform desktop app
- Three.js for 3D math (orthographic views, not rendering)
- Y-up coordinate system (matches Unreal Engine)

**Design Principles:**
- Focus on woodworking/CAD use case
- Keep UI clean and uncluttered
- Prefer keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Theme support (Light, Dark, Blueprint)

**Development Process:**
- Commit after each major feature completion
- Test thoroughly before moving to next feature
- Use this todo_master.md for task tracking across sessions
- Regular git commits with descriptive messages
